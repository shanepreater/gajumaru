Repo for the gaju onboarding / development help

# Getting started
## The Simple Option
1. run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shanepreater/gajumaru/refs/heads/main/quick-start.sh  && bash quick-start.sh`

That is all!

## The More involved option
In order to set everything up you will need to run the following scripts:
1. `sudo ./setup-erlang.sh`
2. `./setup-gaju.sh`
3. *POST REBOOT* `./setup-scripts.sh`

## Post install
This will install and update the software for you to begin mining.

You should have 2 desktop links:
* Gaju Desktop - The Desktop wallet app
* Gaju Miner - The miner app

Prior to being able to use these you will need to right click and click "Allow Launching". This will allow it to launch the scripts.

Initially the desktop icons will look like this: ![Desktop icon pre-enabling](images/icon-with-cross.png?raw=true "Cleanly installed icon")
If you try to run before enabling you will get an error like this: ![Launch error](images/launch-fail.png?raw=true "Launcher failure")


# Headless mining
You can also setup the system to perform headless mining (The mining service has no UI components so runs totally in the background)

This is a more advanced version so if you have any doubts, simply use the GajuMining shortcut.

## Setup
1. You need to have created your mining account (and associated wallet)
2. You need to have your public key (Account Id) to hand
3. run `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shanepreater/gajumaru/refs/heads/main/setup-headless-mining.sh  && bash setup-headless-mining.sh <PUBKEY> <MINERS>` - Where PUBKEY is your public key and MINERS is the number of concurrent miners to run (probably stick to 1 or 2).

As part of the initial install, you will have "cloned" (I.E. downloaded) the gajumaru scripts repository. typically this is in ~/gajumaru.
You can find the setup-headless-miner.sh script there as well.

## Post install
Everytime the system is rebooted, it will automatically launch the headless miner system.
